# qualia_space
Random Movement Game
This is a simple game implemented using the Pygame library. The player controls a red dot, which moves in random directions when an arrow key is pressed. The objective of the game is to reach the white prize bar as quickly as possible. The player's score increases every time the red dot collides with the prize bar.

This script can also be used as a part of research for a philosophical paper that assumes qualia space as another dimension. The paper may claim that people intersect the qualia space of the computer to win the game faster than completely random movements would allow.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library (Install via pip install pygame)
How to Run
Ensure that you have Python 3.x and the Pygame library installed on your machine.
Save the game script to a file named random_movement_game.py.
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
Run the script using the command python random_movement_game.py.
Controls
Press the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, or Right) to move the red dot in random directions.
Notes
The game displays the actual path and the optimal path taken by the red dot to reach the prize bar.
After reaching the prize bar, the game will pause for 3 seconds and restart automatically.
